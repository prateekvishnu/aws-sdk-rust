# aws-sdk-frauddetector

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

This is the Amazon Fraud Detector API Reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about Amazon Fraud Detector API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Amazon Fraud Detector features, see the [Amazon Fraud Detector User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/frauddetector/latest/ug/).

We provide the Query API as well as AWS software development kits (SDK) for Amazon Fraud Detector in Java and Python programming languages.

The Amazon Fraud Detector Query API provides HTTPS requests that use the HTTP verb GET or POST and a Query parameter Action. AWS SDK provides libraries, sample code, tutorials, and other resources for software developers who prefer to build applications using language-specific APIs instead of submitting a request over HTTP or HTTPS. These libraries provide basic functions that automatically take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing your requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses, so that it is easier for you to get started. For more information about the AWS SDKs, see [Tools to build on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/aws.amazon.com/tools/).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-frauddetector` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.46.0"
aws-sdk-frauddetector = "0.16.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
