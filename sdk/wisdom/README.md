# aws-sdk-wisdom

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Amazon Connect Wisdom delivers agents the information they need to solve customer issues as they're actively speaking with customers. Agents can search across connected repositories from within their agent desktop to find answers quickly. Use the Amazon Connect Wisdom APIs to create an assistant and a knowledge base, for example, or manage content by uploading custom files.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-wisdom` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.12.0"
aws-sdk-wisdom = "0.12.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
