# aws-sdk-ivschat

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

__Introduction__

The Amazon IVS Chat control-plane API enables you to create and manage Amazon IVS Chat resources. You also need to integrate with the [Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/chat-messaging-api.html), to enable users to interact with chat rooms in real time.

The API is an AWS regional service. For a list of supported regions and Amazon IVS Chat HTTPS service endpoints, see the Amazon IVS Chat information on the [Amazon IVS page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html) in the _AWS General Reference_.

__Notes on terminology:__
  - You create service applications using the Amazon IVS Chat API. We refer to these as _applications_.
  - You create front-end client applications (browser and Android/iOS apps) using the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API. We refer to these as _clients_.

__Resources__

The following resource is part of Amazon IVS Chat:
  - __Room__ — The central Amazon IVS Chat resource through which clients connect to and exchange chat messages. See the Room endpoints for more information.

__API Access Security__

Your Amazon IVS Chat applications (service applications and clients) must be authenticated and authorized to access Amazon IVS Chat resources. Note the differences between these concepts:
  - _Authentication_ is about verifying identity. Requests to the Amazon IVS Chat API must be signed to verify your identity.
  - _Authorization_ is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to have permissions for Amazon IVS Chat API requests.

Users (viewers) connect to a room using secure access tokens that you create using the CreateChatToken endpoint through the AWS SDK. You call CreateChatToken for every user’s chat session, passing identity and authorization information about the user.

__Signing API Requests__

HTTP API requests must be signed with an AWS SigV4 signature using your AWS security credentials. The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the AWS SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS Chat HTTP API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests.

You generate a signature using valid AWS credentials for an IAM role that has permission to perform the requested action. For example, DeleteMessage requests must be made using an IAM role that has the ivschat:DeleteMessage permission.

For more information:
  - Authentication and generating signatures — See [Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.
  - Managing Amazon IVS permissions — See [Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html) on the Security page of the _Amazon IVS User Guide_.

__Messaging Endpoints__
  - DeleteMessage — Sends an event to a specific room which directs clients to delete a specific message; that is, unrender it from view and delete it from the client’s chat history. This event’s EventName is aws:DELETE_MESSAGE. This replicates the [DeleteMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-deletemessage-publish.html) WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API.
  - DisconnectUser — Disconnects all connections using a specified user ID from a room. This replicates the [DisconnectUser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-disconnectuser-publish.html) WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API.
  - SendEvent — Sends an event to a room. Use this within your application’s business logic to send events to clients of a room; e.g., to notify clients to change the way the chat UI is rendered.

__Chat Token Endpoint__
  - CreateChatToken — Creates an encrypted token that is used to establish an individual WebSocket connection to a room. The token is valid for one minute, and a connection (session) established with the token is valid for the specified duration.

__Room Endpoints__
  - CreateRoom — Creates a room that allows clients to connect and pass messages.
  - DeleteRoom — Deletes the specified room.
  - GetRoom — Gets the specified room.
  - ListRooms — Gets summary information about all your rooms in the AWS region where the API request is processed.
  - UpdateRoom — Updates a room’s configuration.

__Tags Endpoints__
  - ListTagsForResource — Gets information about AWS tags for the specified ARN.
  - TagResource — Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the specified ARN.
  - UntagResource — Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN.

All the above are HTTP operations. There is a separate _messaging_ API for managing Chat resources; see the [Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/chat-messaging-api.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-ivschat` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.46.0"
aws-sdk-ivschat = "0.16.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
