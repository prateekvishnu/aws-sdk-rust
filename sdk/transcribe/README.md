# aws-sdk-transcribe

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Amazon Transcribe offers three main types of batch transcription: __Standard__, __Medical__, and __Call Analytics__.
  - __Standard transcriptions__ are the most common option. Refer to for details.
  - __Medical transcriptions__ are tailored to medical professionals and incorporate medical terms. A common use case for this service is transcribing doctor-patient dialogue into after-visit notes. Refer to for details.
  - __Call Analytics transcriptions__ are designed for use with call center audio on two different channels; if you're looking for insight into customer service calls, use this option. Refer to for details.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-transcribe` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.46.0"
aws-sdk-transcribe = "0.16.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
